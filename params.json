{"name":"React-wizard","tagline":"React Wizard component","body":"#react-wizard\r\nWizard is a typical wizard element for installs, mulitpart forms, etc. It takes a steps prop with an array of Step objects, start prop with optional integer to skip into the step array, and any othr props you will need later on in Step methods as a data prop. \r\n\r\n#install\r\n```\r\nnpm install react-wizard\r\n```\r\n#steps\r\nSteps consist of:\r\n* name - name of step shown to user as list element\r\n* component - react CreatClass function of your content. \r\n* onSubmit - your 'validate' function. If it returns an error the step is not advanced and that error will be shown to user. Successful callback advances to next step.\r\n* onBack - a function to called before leaving step. Used to cleanup.\r\n\r\n#examples\r\nThere are pure js examples in the examples directory using beefy. npm install if necesssary\r\n```\r\nnpm i\r\n```\r\nThen go into an example directory and use beefy to run an example\r\n```\r\nbeefy --index=index.html main.js:bundle.js 8080\r\n```\r\nThen load your browser up at http://localhost:8080\r\n\r\n##note:\r\nBack button is automatically disabled on first step.\r\nThe built in buttons are removed from the last step so remember to provide buttons/links on your last step for your user to escape.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to @brianshaler for the code review that turned into an entire rewrite\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
